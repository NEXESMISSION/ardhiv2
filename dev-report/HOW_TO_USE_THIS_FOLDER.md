# How to Use This Folder - Simple Guide

## 🎯 You Have This Folder

This folder (`dev-report`) contains everything to build the app. That's it. Nothing else needed.

## 📋 What's Inside?

### Main Documents (Read These in Order)

1. **`00_WHAT_IS_THIS_APP.md`**
   - Explains what the app does
   - Simple explanation
   - Read this first to understand

2. **`01_START_HERE.md`**
   - Tells you what to do
   - Quick overview
   - Read this second

3. **`02_SETUP_PROJECT.md`**
   - Step-by-step setup
   - Copy and paste commands
   - Follow exactly

4. **`03_BUILD_FEATURES.md`**
   - Build features step-by-step
   - Phase by phase
   - Follow in order

### REFERENCE Folder (Use When Needed)

Don't read all at once. Just check when you need something:

- **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md** - Copy SQL code for database

### FEATURES Folder (Use When Building)

Check these when building specific features:

- **USER_MANAGEMENT.md** - User system
- **WORKER_TITLES.md** - Worker titles
- **LAND_MANAGEMENT.md** - Land features

- **FINANCIAL.md** - Financial features
- **OWNER_ACTIONS.md** - Owner actions

## 🚀 How to Start

### Step 1: Read Main Documents
1. Read `00_WHAT_IS_THIS_APP.md` (optional but helpful)
2. Read `01_START_HERE.md` (required)
3. Follow `02_SETUP_PROJECT.md` (required)
4. Follow `03_BUILD_FEATURES.md` (required)

### Step 2: Use Reference When Needed
- When `03_BUILD_FEATURES.md` says "see REFERENCE/...", check that file
- Don't read all reference files at once
- Just check what you need when you need it

### Step 3: Use Features When Building
- When building a feature, check the relevant file in FEATURES/
- Get details and code examples
- Build the feature

## ✅ Simple Rules

1. **Follow main documents in order** - Don't skip
2. **Use reference when needed** - Don't read all at once
3. **Check features when building** - Get details as needed
4. **Test as you go** - Don't build everything then test

## 🎯 That's It!

Just follow the 4 main documents. Everything else is there when you need it.

**Start with `00_WHAT_IS_THIS_APP.md` or `01_START_HERE.md`!**
